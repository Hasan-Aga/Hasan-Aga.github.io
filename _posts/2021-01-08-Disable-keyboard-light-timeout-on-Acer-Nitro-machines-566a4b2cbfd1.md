I recently bought a laptop from Acer, specifically the Nitro 5 model, I like the machine but one thing I didn’t like was the keyboard, unlike most backlit keyboards, this one does not light up when you use the mouse or touchpad, which makes for a bad user experience.

In their defense, the Nitro 5 is aimed towards gamers, but even gamers need to type!

#### How to disable the timeout

Acer provides a program called “Nitrosense”, mostly used to monitor the CPU/GPU speed & temp, but tucked inside is a little option to disable the keyboard-light’s timeout completely

go to the setting icon on the top right, and disable “Backlight off after 30 seconds”.
