# Blender is Fun

I have several hobbies and recently I realized that they all have something in common; they all revolve around making things. Take Blender 3D, my most recent hobby for example, it revolves around creating beautiful 3D (or 2D) designs and giving these designs life by applying colors and textures on them.

Here is what I managed to whip up in hour of spare time:

Is that pretty or what üòç? the car model I got from a Behance user for free and I colored and lit the scene as an exercise. I wish to one day be skilled enough to create beautiful models and share them with people for free.
