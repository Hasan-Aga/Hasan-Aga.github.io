# Who Am I?!

Hi,
My name is **Hasan** and I decided to create my own blog. I have a blog on [Medium](https://hasan-alsulaiman.medium.com/) and I
love it's simplicity, but I feel that having my own blog is more useful. I plan on blogging about programming and graphic design. I love making things and both programming and graphic design revolve around creating things.

I am from [Iraq]([Google Haritalar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iraq/@33.1402482,39.2240649,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1557823d54f54a11:0x6da561bba2061602!8m2!3d33.223191!4d43.679291)) and I currently reside in Turkiye. I have studied Communication Engineering  and I am interested in network virtualization.

## Favourite Programming Languages

I love Java because I learned OOP with it. Java gets a lot of criticisim for being unwealdy, but that is only because Java has the burden of long legacy that it has to keep running.

I also love the simplicity of Python. My first choice for quick proof-of-concept programm would be Python, but I like typed programming languages better, that is why I was really impressed by Dart as it has beautiful syntax with a familiar type system.

## Academic Achievments

I do not like the rythm of the academic world, however I do like scientific research, I am currently a graduate student in the Electric & Computer Institution of Abdullah Gul University. I hate taking tests and preparing for tests, I prefer working and researching naturally by studying what the job or task requires me to study.

## Personal Hobbies

I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/meekanik/), so I may share some photos. I like movies but not the stupid
Type of movies they seem to produce nowadays. 

### My Favourite Movies:

* The Last Sammurai

* The Girl with the Dragon Tatto

* The Dark Knight

Genrally speaking I like any movie directed by David Fincher or Christopher Nolan.
