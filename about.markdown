# Who Am I?!

Hi,
My name is **Hasan** and I decided to create my own blog. I have a blog on [Medium](https://hasan-alsulaiman.medium.com/) and I
love it's simplicity, but I feel that having my own blog is more useful. I plan on blogging about programming and graphic design. I love making things and both programming and graphic design revolve around creating things.

I am from Iraq and I currently reside in Turkiye. I have studied Communication Engineering and I am interested in network virtualization.

## Favourite Programming Languages

I currently work with JavaScript and Typescript. I build my apps using React, NextJS, Node and Postgres/MongoDB.
I love Java because I learned OOP with it.

## Personal Hobbies

I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/meekanik/), so I may share some photos. I like movies but not the stupid
Type of movies they seem to produce nowadays.

### My Favourite Movies:

- The Last Sammurai

- The Girl with the Dragon Tatto

- The Dark Knight

Genrally speaking I like any movie directed by David Fincher or Christopher Nolan.

# Its me, Hasan!
